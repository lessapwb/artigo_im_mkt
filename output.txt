Al-Weshah G.A.	Marketing intelligence and customer relationships: Empirical evidence from jordanian banks	2017	Journal of Marketing Analytics	This study aims at investigating the role of marketing intelligence in maintaining and building cus-tomer’s relationships in Jordanian banks. More specifically, to measure the effect of marketing intelligence on maintaining and building current and new customer’s relation-ships. The quantitative design has been built in the study methodology such as descriptive and hypothesis testing methods. A self-administrated questionnaire has been developed as data generation instrument. Using the con-venient sample, 110 questionnaires were distributed to executives of marketing, customer relationships, information systems, and customer services who work in Jordanian banks’ headquarters. Only 85 questionnaires were returned with response rate 77%. The study concludes that there is significant positive effect for MI on maintaining and building both current and new customer relationships. However, MI practices in Jordanian banks tend to get a new customer rather than to retain an existing one. More-over, Jordanian banks have potentials to upgrade their marketing intelligence systems in order to achieve competitive advantages based on customer relationship approach. The study provides important lessons in applying marketing intelligence in maintaining and building customer relationships for practitioners or executives in banking industry. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.

Kanchanapoom K.; Chongwatpol J.	Applications of business intelligence and marketing analytics in the complementary and alternative medicine industry	2020	Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases	This case is designed to illustrate the application of business intelligence and marketing analytics to making proper decisions in a competitor-oriented pricing environment. The case started when Dan, the director of a business analytics consulting firm, was assigned a big project: to help Panacée Medical Center, one of the leading service providers in complementary and alternative medicine industry, envisage possible marketing strategies in response to competitors’ recent moves that threatened the sales and marketing strategies of its business. The case is divided into three parts. Case A provided an overview of challenges Panacée was facing when one of its competitors, Beauty and Clinic, was about to offer full complementary and alternative medicine services with a newly renovated, 5-star, resort-type clinic and high-quality facilities and another competitor, Natural Health Center, planned to promote its recent investment in a new laboratory that met international standards at the upcoming Thailand Health & Wellness Expo. Case B focused on insights into customers through different analytical techniques. Case C implicitly outlined possible strategies that might be applicable to Panacée, especially when the services from both Beauty and Clinic and Natural Health Center were expected to be priced 5% to 25% below the established market price. Dan needed to decide which direction he needed to propose to Panacée’s top management, as the combination of low prices and premium services threatened the medical center and Panacée might lose as much as 30% of its forecast revenue next year. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2020.
Yang C.-S.; Chen C.-H.; Chang P.-C.	Harnessing consumer reviews for marketing intelligence: a domain-adapted sentiment classification approach	2015	Information Systems and e-Business Management	With the success and proliferation of Web 2.0 applications, consumers can use the Internet for shopping, comparing products, and publishing product reviews on various social media sites. Such consumer reviews are valuable assets in applications supporting marketing intelligence. However, the rapidly increasing number of consumer reviews makes it difficult for businesses or consumers to obtain a comprehensive view of consumer opinions pertaining to a product of interest when manual analysis techniques are used. Thus, developing data analysis tools that can automatically analyze consumer reviews to summarize consumer sentiments is both desirable and essential. Accordingly, this study was focused on the sentiment classification of consumer reviews. To address the domain-dependency problem typically encountered in sentiment classification and other sentiment analysis applications, we propose a domain-adapted sentiment-classification (DA-SC) technique for inducing a domain-independent base classifier and using a cotraining mechanism to adapt the base classifier to a specific application domain of interest. Our empirical evaluation results show that the performance of the proposed DA-SC technique is superior or comparable to similar techniques for classifying consumer reviews into appropriate sentiment categories. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
Boikanyo D.H.; Lotriet R.; Buys P.W.	Investigating the use of business, competitive and marketing intelligence as management tools in the mining industry	2016	Problems and Perspectives in Management	The main objective of this research study is to investigate the extent to which business intelligence, competitive intelligence and marketing intelligence are used within the mining industry. Business intelligence, competitive intelligence and marketing intelligence are the management tools used to mine information to produce up-to-date intelligence and knowledge for operative and strategic decision making. A structured questionnaire is used for the study. A total of 300 mines are randomly selected from a research population of mining organizations in South Africa, Africa and globally. The respondents are all part of senior management. A response rate of 64% is achieved. The results indicat that more than half of the respondents do not have real-time intelligence and proper data mining tools to identify patterns and relationships within a data warehouse. Although a large proportion agrees that their organizations have systematic ways of gathering these different types of intelligence and use them for strategic decision making, there is a significant proportion that did not have any systems. Statistically and practically significant positive relationships with a large effect are found among the dimensions of business intelligence, marketing intelligence, competitive intelligence and perceived business performance. © Dinko Herman Boikanyo, Ronnie Lotriet, Pieter W.

Market Analysis with Business Intelligence System for Marketing Planning	2023	Information (Switzerland)	The automotive and auto parts industries are important economic sectors in Thailand. With rapidly changing technology, every organization should understand what needs to be improved clearly, and shift their strategies to meet evolving consumer demands. The purpose of this research is to develop a Business Intelligence system for a brake pad manufacturing company in Thailand. By analyzing the relationship between market demand and supply components of the company through regression analysis and the principles of the marketing mix, we develop a product lifecycle curve for forecasting product sales. The developed system increases the workflow efficiency of the case study company, being able to simplify the traditional data preparation process that requires employees to collect and summarize data every time a request is made. An intelligence dashboard is subsequently created to help support decision-making, facilitate communication within the company, and eventually improve team efficiency and productivity. © 2023 by the authors.
Lies J.	Marketing Intelligence: Boom or Bust of Service Marketing?	2022	International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence	Marketing intelligence fosters two major developments within digital service marketing. On the one hand, a boom of services seems to have evolved, accelerated by the opportunities of marketing intelligence. It has contributed to the optimization of customer experiences, e.g., supported by mobile, personalized, and customized marketing services. On the other hand, (digital) self-services are likely to pervert the term “service”. Lifecycle marketing, including annoying marketing communication in real-time, automated price adjustment and programmatic advertising based on artificial intelligence, affects the vision of fully standardized marketing automation. Additionally, there are incentives to pollute the digital information in order to manufacture opinions. Fake news is one popular example. This leads to the (open) question if marketing intelligence means service boom or bust of marketing. This contribution aims to elaborate the boom-and-bust aspects of marketing intelligence and suggests a trade-off. The method applied in this paper will be a descriptive and conceptual literature review, through which the paradigmatic thoughts will be juxtaposed from the perspective of service. © 2022, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Karami M.; Hossain M.	Marketing intelligence and small firms' performance: the role of entrepreneurial alertness and effectuation	2024	Marketing Intelligence and Planning	Purpose: Knowledge of how entrepreneurial alertness (EA) and effectuation impact small firms' performance in uncertain markets is limited. Suggesting effectuation as a mediation mechanism between EA and small firms' performance, the authors explore how entrepreneurs of small firms apply effectual logic to translate their individual alertness to market opportunities into firms' performance. Design/methodology/approach: A set of hypotheses is tested by partial least squares analysis of survey data collected from small firms in New Zealand. Findings: The results show that effectuation works as a mechanism that mediates a positive association between founders'/managers' alertness to market opportunities and small firms' performance. Originality/value: Integrating EA with the effectuation theory, the authors contribute to the literature on new market opportunity development and firm performance. The authors argue that entrepreneurs concentrate on action and resources to further develop their marketing intelligence in developing new market opportunities. The authors also enhance the understanding of entrepreneurial marketing decision-making by small firms in a relatively small economy in the Asia–Pacific region. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.
Weng W.-H.	Effect of IoT on Marketing Intelligence and Business Strategy: An Organizational Capability Perspective	2021	International Journal of Electronic Commerce Studies	Innovative developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) have invoked tremendous attention from both academics and industries. Studies suggest that IoT not only serves as an innovative tool for enterprise operations but also triggers impacts on business performance. As researchers increasingly raise issues about the business value of IoT, this study examines its direct and indirect managerial effects by investigating the link between IoT and business strategy. From the organizational capability perspective, this study constructed a research framework in which marketing intelligence capability mediates the effect of IoT capability on business strategy formation. This research performed an empirical survey and analyzed the data to test the hypotheses in the research framework. The results confirmed the partial mediating effect of marketing intelligence capability in the link between IoT capability and business strategy formation. The paper then discussed the test results and elaborated on the managerial implications. © 2021 Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research. All rights reserved.

This communication space was quickly taken over by marketing tools, as demonstrated by the many marketing campaigns dedicated to these new communication channels. The development of online commerce and the emergence of social networks have allowed consumers to efficiently search for brands/products/services, compare them, express their point of view on them, and even give them grades. Due to the explosion of relevant data online, the changing business environment needs attention to interpret and extract relevant information. The application of sentiment analysis to public reaction in the online environment provides the researcher with how the authors of the analyzed texts (clients/beneficiaries) express themselves regarding the studied reference (product/service/organization/social theme and a feature of them). Along with the other metrics present in marketing, including digital marketing, the reports in the analysis panels of google analytics and social networks, sentiment analysis instantly provides the general and competitive context in which the product/service/theme evolves. In this article, two types of research have been conducted to highlight the benefits felt, but also the degree of knowledge, implementation, and use of sentiment analysis in online marketing analysis. One of the types of research was qualitative, carried out on 10 participants (specialists in the field of marketing), with the help of an interview guide. Qualitative research aims to find out the level of knowledge of sentiment analysis and the general degree of digitalization of Romanian companies, an indicator considered critical in the new post-pandemic business environment. The second research was quantitative and used to develop analysis by structural equations. For this, a questionnaire applied to a sample of 108 respondents was used. Through the analysis by structural equations, a conceptual model was developed that presents the main factors that are related to others and that contribute to the satisfaction of the users of the analysis of feelings for obtaining marketing data. @ by the authors.

SMEs internationalization: The role of product innovation, market intelligence, pricing and marketing communication capabilities as drivers of SMEs’ international performance	2020	Technological Forecasting and Social Change	Small and medium enterprise (SME) competitive advantage has been recognized as an important topic for researchers dealing with SME internationalization. Previous studies have long discussed the role of firm competitive advantage as a determinant of international performance, but there are few studies analyzing the determinants of firm competitive advantage and its potential mediating role in the relationship between organizational capabilities and SMEs' international performance. In this paper, we hypothesize four essential export capabilities (market intelligence, product innovation, pricing, and marketing communication) as determinants of competitive advantage for exporting SMEs. Based on a sample of 119 active exporting Malaysian SMEs and using partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling, the results revealed that three of the mentioned capabilities lead to competitive advantage. In addition, results indicated that competitive advantage only acts as a mediator between pricing capability and SMEs' international performance. The main conclusions of this investigation can be valuable to SMEs and startups that intend to explore or exploit opportunities in foreign markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Hattula J.D.; Schmitz C.; Schmidt M.; Reinecke S.	Is more always better? An investigation into the relationship between marketing influence and managers' market intelligence dissemination	2015	International Journal of Research in Marketing	How does the influence of the marketing department within an organization affect marketing managers' dissemination of market intelligence (i.e., knowledge about customer needs and competitor activities) to managers of other departments? Three studies with 711 executive managers and integrated survey and experimental data offer insights. Rather than the positive relationship indicated by conventional wisdom, the study results indicate a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped effect of marketing's influence on marketing managers' dissemination of market intelligence. Managers in a marketing department with moderate influence within the organization are significantly more likely to disseminate market intelligence than are those in low and, interestingly, those in high influence departments. This finding adds nuance to the existing body of knowledge showing countervailing effects of a strong marketing department and implies that executives need to carefully manage the organization's culture to ensure well-balanced influences of the marketing department in relation to other corporate functions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Carson G.; O'Connor C.; Simmons G.	The crucial role of market intelligence in the development of small business marketing capabilities	2020	Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development	Purpose: Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this article explores the influences of market intelligence on the development of small business marketing capabilities, with reference to specialized marketing capabilities, architectural marketing capabilities and dynamic capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework and propositions present and interpret the resource–capability complementarity between market intelligence and small business marketing capabilities and outline the relationship between individual capability sets. Findings: Market intelligence is shown to be crucial in the development of small business marketing capabilities and in the implementation of more formalized marketing strategies that allow small businesses to create value for customers and improve their performance. However, the level to which market intelligence is utilized and marketing capabilities are developed is found to be considerably influenced by the small business owner-manager and firm learning. Practical implications: It is imperative that small businesses acknowledge the practical benefits of market intelligence and harness these advantages accordingly. However, owner-managers must be motivated to encourage the development of more formalized marketing capabilities and act incisively upon the information derived from market intelligence. Originality/value: Recent research indicates that market intelligence and marketing capabilities can interact to enable a firm to align its resources with the market, by providing customer insights that guide them as to which value-adding activities they should implement. However, extant research in this area remains in its infancy, and very little is known about the adoption processes of market intelligence in small businesses and its role in developing marketing capabilities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Venter P.; van Rensburg M.J.	The relationship between marketing intelligence and strategic marketing	2014	South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences	Despite the importance attached to MI and other marketing information functions, surprisingly few studies have explicitly examined the relationship between MI and strategic marketing decision-making. This article reports on a study conducted with the aim of determining the relationship between marketing intelligence (MI) and strategic marketing in South African organisations. A quantitative survey was conducted among 166 South African marketing decision-makers. The findings suggest a substantial gap between the importance and availability of key types of MI. Marketing decision-makers found the traditional MI and marketing tools of great value in supporting marketing decision-making, but the value of several of the newer MI tools and technologies was less clear. An analysis of MI practices suggested that MI quality and particularly information and communication technology (ICT) support for MI are areas requiring further attention.

Findings: The findings indicated that the two variables of marketing intelligence and risk-taking ability of the librarians have no direct, significant influence on user loyalty, while competitive advantage directly affects it. However, marketing intelligence and risk-taking ability can influence user loyalty if mediated through competitive advantage. Results: If the librarians of kids/teens libraries can use their marketing intelligence to take reasonable risks, they can create a competitive advantage in service provision. The users will hence realize this advantage, thus turning into loyal users. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Elham Kiani, Mitra Pashootanizadeh and Azarnoush Ansari. ©, © Elham Kiani, Mitra Pashootanizadeh and Azarnoush Ansari.
Da Silva MARQUES L.K.; Vidigal F.	Prosumers and social networks as marketing information sources: An analysis from the perspective of competitive intelligence in Brazilian companies; [Prosumers e redes sociais como fontes de informação mercadológica: Uma análise sob a perspectiva da inteligência competitiva em empresas brasileiras]	2018	Transinformacao	The Internet and Web 2.0 changed the way people obtain information and relate to the environment they live in. In this context, social networks emerge as indispensable sources of information on the wide intelligence process, accessible and low-cost, which need to be better understood and exploited, as they can create advantage for companies. This study aims to determine how social networks are used in the information gathering phase, focused on competitive intelligence. The intention was to propose an analytical and conceptual model of verification of social networks as sources of information. Therefore, there was a qualitative, exploratory and descriptive study based on semi-structured interviews and covering five national companies of different segments and sizes, engaged in the Competitive Intelligence activity. For the data analysis, we elected the content analysis technique, and the systematization of information was performed with the software Atlas.ti. The results showed that companies are attentive to social networks as sources of information, as they recognize their importance primarily due to direct contact with prosumers, and highlight the need for their verification, considering the model as very important and feasible for sorting market information.
Iwu-James J.; Haliso Y.; Ifijeh G.	Leveraging Competitive Intelligence for Successful Marketing of Academic Library Services	2020	New Review of Academic Librarianship	Academic libraries are increasingly becoming affected by intrusive and disruptive technologies, changing user needs, and alternative information providers who offer similar services as the library. The dilemma of academic libraries is evident, based on the declining support from parent institutions and decreasing patronage. In the face of stiff competition, their response has to be rapid in order to preserve their position. Academic librarians cannot effectively prepare for the future or position themselves until they understand the nature of their competitors and what draws the customers to them. To remain relevant, librarians must re-strategize their marketing techniques using competitive intelligence (CI). The article explores practical application of CI principles and strategies to the marketing mix variables of academic libraries. It identifies competitive strategies that could give library marketing a competitive edge. The article also identifies possible challenges in implementing competitive intelligence strategies in marketing for academic libraries and makes recommendations. The article concludes that it is expedient for academic libraries to adopt competitive intelligence to guide their marketing efforts so as to guarantee the survival and continuous growth of academic libraries. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. ©, © Juliana Iwu-James, Yacob Haliso and Goodluck Ifijeh.

Seidlova R.; Poživil J.; Seidl J.	Marketing and business intelligence with help of ant colony algorithm	2019	Journal of Strategic Marketing	Recently, there is increasing need of banks for targeting and acquiring new customers, for fraud detection in real time and for segmentation products through analysis of the customers. Doing it, they can serve their customers better, and can increase the effectiveness of the company. For this purpose, various data mining methods are used which enable extraction of interesting, nontrivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful patterns or knowledge from huge amounts of data. Traditional data mining methods include classification rule tasks, for their solution there are a number of methods. Among them can be mentioned, for example, Random forest algorithm or C4.5 algorithm. However, accuracy of these methods significantly reduces in the event that some data in databases is missing. These methods are always not optimal for very large databases. The aim of our work is to verify a possible solution of these problems by using the algorithm based on artificial ant colonies. This algorithm was successful in other areas. Therefore, we tested its applicability and accuracy in marketing and business intelligence and compared it with so far used methods. The experimental results showed that the presented algorithm is very effective, robust, and suitable for processing of very large files. It was also found that this algorithm overcomes the previously used algorithms in accuracy. Algorithm is easily implementable on different platforms and can be recommended for using in banking and business intelligence. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Identifying and Prioritizing the Factors Affecting Online Marketing Strategies Based on Competitive Intelligence in Iraqi Telecommunication Companies	2024	Journal of Ecohumanism	The business climate is changing quickly and continuously these days due to the advancement of technology and the expansion of global trade. Accordingly, businesses have had to modify their marketing plans to fit this new environment in order to stay competitive, and E-marketing has become a popular alternative. In order to accomplish this, the study will look into the variables influencing i nternet marketing tactics in the Iraqi telecom sector and rank them according to competitive intelligence. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 academic specialists and marketing managers from Iraqi telecommunications companies were also conducted as part of this study to determine the fundamental elements of competitive intelligence and important internal and external factors influencing online marketing strategies. The researchers employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique to rank the most important vari ables identified by the quantitative analysis. The strategic standing of competitors is determined to be the most important external component in internet marketing strategies, based on study findings and expert opinions. Perceived product quality is the most significant internal component of online marketing strategy, according to experts. The most significant sub-criterion in the "competitive intelligence" criterion is "technological intelligence," out of the five sub-criteria. However, the research yields significant information that telecommunication firms in Iraq may utilize to improve their decision-making procedures, allocate resources optimally, and create online marketing strategies that are competitive environment-responsive. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

Hendar H.; Ratnawati A.; Razak W.M.W.A.; Abdullah Z.	Market intelligence on business performance: The mediating role of specialized marketing capabilities	2020	Journal of Intelligence Studies in Business	This study aims to investigate and examine the mediating role of specialized marketing capabilities (SMC) in the relationship between market intelligence (MI) and business performance (BP) on Indonesia retail fashion SMEs. This study used 330 SMEs with maximum assets of 10 billion Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and a maximum sales turnover of IDR 50 billion per year. We examined the relationship between MI dimensions: market intelligence generation (MIG), market intelligence dissemination (MID), and responsiveness to market intelligence (RMI) with SMC and BP by using a combination of SPSS and SEM with AMOS 22.0. A Sobel test was used to test the mediating role of SMC in the relationship between MI dimensions and BP. The results of the data analysis show that SMC has an important role as a partial mediator in the relationship between MIG, MID, and RMI with BP. This study suggests that owners or managers of SMEs recognize important market intelligence factors in increasing SMC and BP. This helps them make better investment decisions in developing the right combination of SMC to increase BP. This research integrates MI dimensions and one dimension of marketing capabilities, i.e. SMC, into an empirical model to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between MI and SMC and how these factors form BP. © 2020 Halmstad University.

Many companies are benefited from these modeling methods for their marketing efforts. Each firm has expected to increase its product development in an innovative way to improve its business growth. Successful firm marketing is to offer the right product to the right person at the right time. To market the product to the customer successfully, it is needed to segment the customer by finding their behavioral patterns. The customer behaviors and their purchasing patterns are used to generate profit for the company. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers based on commonalities. Developing an efficient AI-based customer segmentation to improve digital marketing growth is a challenging task. In this paper, an unsupervised deep learning model called a Self-organizing map with an Improved social spider optimization approach has been used for efficient customer segmentation. The customer data are analyzed by a feature engineering process using a swarm intelligence model called Modified social spider optimization to select the behavioral features of the customer. Then, the customers are clustered using Self Organizing neural network (SONN). Based on the clusters, the customers are classified using the Deep neural network (DNN) model. The experimental results prove the performance of the proposed model with high clustering and segmentation capability to improve the business profit in marketing. © 2022

Jensen J.A.; Wakefield L.; Cobbs J.B.; Turner B.A.	Forecasting sponsorship costs: marketing intelligence in the athletic apparel industry	2016	Marketing Intelligence and Planning	Purpose – Due in large part to the proprietary nature of costs, there is a dearth of academic literature investigating the factors influencing the costs for sport marketing investments, such as sponsorship. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical framework for market intelligence that enables managers to better predict and forecast costs in today’s ever-changing sport marketing environment. Design/methodology/approach – Given the dynamic and ultra-competitive nature of the athletic apparel industry, this context was chosen to investigate the influence of four distinct factors on sponsorship costs, including property-specific factors, on-field performance, and market-specific factors. A systematic, hierarchical procedure was utilized in the development of a predictive empirical model, which was then utilized to generate predicted values on a per property basis. Findings – Results demonstrated that both property-specific and performance-related factors were significant predictors of costs, while variables reflecting the attractiveness of the property’s home market were non-significant. Further analysis revealed the potential for agency conflicts in the allocation of resources toward properties near the corporate headquarters of sponsors, as well as evidence of overspending by challenger brands (Adidas, Under Armour) in their quest to topple industry leader Nike. Originality/value – Though the context of apparel sponsorships of US-based intercollegiate athletic programs limits the generalizability of the results, this study represents one of the few in the literature to empirically investigate the determinants of sponsorship costs, providing much-needed guidance to aid decision making in a highly volatile, unpredictable industry. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Arumugam T.; Sanjeev M.A.; Mathai R.K.; Prabhu S.R.B.; Balamourougane R.; Jarin T.	An empirical verification of the proposed distributor marketing intelligence system model	2024	International Journal of Business Information Systems	Distributors are close to the customers and vital in understanding them; thus act as a serious link in any organisation’s marketing intelligence system. Distributors are also critical in local adaptation of the company’s marketing activities based on the prevalent local conditions, which is essential for market success. The distributor choice-making pattern deals with their selling and marketing parameters’ everyday choice based on their appraisal of data about competitors, clients, and other local factors (the local market intelligence) helping them adapt to local customer requirements. This study uses a descriptive cross-sectional design to ascertain the reliability and validity of the proposed distributor marketing intelligence system (DMiS) model and to ascertain the degree of responsiveness exhibited by the distributors based on their market intelligence and marketing involvement, among packaged goods distributors. The resultant scale can find application in recruitment and evaluation of channel partners and in designing suitable training programs for them. © 2024 Inderscience Publishers. All rights reserved.
Al Daabseh T.K.I.; Aljawarneh N.M.; Al Smadi K.; Alnawafleh A.; Al-Maaitah T.A.; Al-Junaidi A.	Integration of business intelligence and marketing: Enhancing corporate reputation in the financial services sector	2024	Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development	This investigation extends into the intricate fabric of customer-based corporate reputation within the banking industry, applying advanced analytics to decipher the nuances of customer perceptions. By integrating structural equation modeling, particularly through SmartPLS4, we thoroughly examine the interrelations of perceived quality, competence, likeability, and trust, and how they culminate in customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our comprehensive dataset is drawn from a varied demographic of banking consumers, ensuring a holistic view of the sector’s reputation dynamics. The research reveals the profound influence of these constructs on customer decision-making, with likeability emerging as a critical driver of satisfaction and allegiance to the bank. We also rigorously test our model’s internal consistency and convergent validity, establishing its reliability and robustness. While the direct involvement of Business Intelligence (BI) tools in the research design may not be overtly articulated, the analytical techniques and data-driven approach at the core of our methodology are synonymous with BI’s capabilities. The insights garnered from our analysis have direct implications for data-driven decision-making in banking. They inform strategies that could include enhancing service personalization, refining reputation management, and improving customer retention efforts. We acknowledge the need to more explicitly detail the role of BI within the research process. BI’s latent presence is inherent in the analytical processes employed to interpret complex data and generate actionable insights, which are crucial for crafting targeted marketing strategies. In summary, our research not only contributes to academic discourse on marketing and customer perception but also implicitly demonstrates the value that BI methodologies bring to understanding and influencing consumer behavior in the banking sector.

Demystifying Big Data Analytics for Business Intelligence Through the Lens of Marketing Mix	2015	Big Data Research	Big data analytics have been embraced as a disruptive technology that will reshape business intelligence, which is a domain that relies on data analytics to gain business insights for better decision-making. Rooted in the recent literature, we investigate the landscape of big data analytics through the lens of a marketing mix framework in this paper. We identify the data sources, methods, and applications related to five important marketing perspectives, namely people, product, place, price, and promotion, that lay the foundation for marketing intelligence. We then discuss several challenging research issues and future directions of research in big data analytics and marketing related business intelligence in general. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Examining the relationship between business intelligence adoption and marketing effectiveness: The mediating role of customer satisfaction	2024	International Journal of Data and Network Science	This study investigates the relationship between business intelligence adoption (Business Intelligence (BI), Data Analysis and Reporting (DAR), Business Process Integration (BPI), and Continuous Improvement and Innovation (CII)) and marketing effectiveness in the Jordanian telecom industry. It specifically examines the mediating role of customer satisfaction in this relationship. A survey design method using the cross-sectional survey was utilized during the research process, involving quantification. The data was collected from 285 employees across the Jordanian telecom sector via electronic response forms. As the analysis's method, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized. The results, which showed BI, DAR and CII to have a positive direct effect on marketing effectiveness, whilst BPI displayed a negative direct impact, were compelling. But clear signs of positive influence on CS by the four dimensions of BI (BI, DAR, BPI, and CII) have also been observed, and this result has been proved to be a mediator between them and business effectiveness. The above study is a source of invaluable learning for the managers of telecom companies in Jordan is a tool that managers in the Jordanian telecom industry will greatly benefit from in the sense that it brings out all the importance of integrating BI, DAR, BPI, and CII practices that emphasize high quality customer service. By properly utilizing these assets and up-to-the-market, companies can improve the effectiveness of marketing and the whole organizational efficiency. The study enhances the existing theory of the interrelationships between the adoption of business intelligence, customer satisfaction, and marketing power which can be viewed from both resource-based view (RBV) theory and expectation-based theory (EDT). It affirms an idea that the RBV was rooted in that when organizational assets are valuable, firms have a competitive advantage and better performance. Also, an EDT states that customer satisfaction increases if the expectations of customers are met. Innovation-The essay is innovative and takes an original angle to explore the multifaceted interconnectivity among business intelligence adoption, customer satisfaction, and marketing effectiveness in the framework of the Jordanian telecom industry. It highlights the steps to customer satisfaction problem solutions and the caution comes with process integration efforts, hence, helping to arrive at a full comprehension of the aspirations for organizational performance in the field. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.
Jandaghi G.; Amini A.; Tavakoli H.	Marketing intelligence of sales force and intermediate role of organizational commitment	2011	Research Journal of Business Management	Marketing intelligence is amongst marketing and behavioral concepts that have received inconsiderable attention. Although, marketing intelligence maybe regarded as peripheral duty of sales force, because of their boundary position, they can offer their company direct access to important information about competitors and customers. In this research, it has been paid to managerial (communication, participation in decision-making, feedback, recognition) factors that were influenced by individual factor such as organizational commitment. The revised proposed model shows that organizational commitment is the most important factors that motivating behavioral effort of sales force toward marketing intelligence activities and managerial communication and motivation toward marketing intelligence has more effectiveness to organizational commitment. © 2011 Academic Journals Inc.
Lin W.-S.; Hsu J.-W.; Yeh M.-Y.	Developing the capability of marketing intelligence: A subjective dynamic capability study	2015	Benchmarking	Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to help firms to create competitiveness by developing marketing capabilities. It analyzes how the component and architectural competences affect and enhance market orientation and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – Built on the theories of organizational capability, knowledge creation, and market orientation, this research develops the contents of marketing capabilities, including component and architectural competences that contribute to marketing capability by responding to external changes, and analyzes their influence on market orientation and firm performance. Findings – The study reveals the following effective marketing capabilities which benefit to marketing performance. First, hiring and retaining employees with higher professional, local, and specific knowledge. Second, firms with higher tacit knowledge enhance market orientation. Third, arranging employees into teamwork to implement marketing tasks. Fourth, assigning employees into small-scale experiments on creative proposals. Fifth, standardizing procedures of generation, dissemination, and response of marketing intelligence. Sixth, providing written market information and training programs to non-marketing staff. Seventh, appropriately delegating to staff. Eighth, establishing apprenticeship among the staff to deliver experiential know-how. Research limitations/implications – From a dynamic capability perspective, this research construct the two kinds of marketing competences and examine their effect on market orientation and firm performance. For further understanding the complementary effects of marketing capabilities, market orientation, and synergistic performance, a larger sample data (e.g. product, market share, sales, characteristics of staff, firm, and knowledge, etc.) and objective evaluation are encouraged. Otherwise, from the viewpoint of agency theory, the incentive system should also be discussed. Practical implications – This research has potentially significant implications for knowledge management and marketing management fields as well as managerial practice. The results suggest the importance of marketing capability for market orientation and firm performance. Originality/value – Marketing resources and marketing capabilities are significant drivers of firm performance, and their impact is greater when they are complementary to each other. This study takes the perspectives of organizational capabilities and market orientation to find out the factors which contribute to marketing capability and performance. This study provides practitioners with a framework for analyzing marketing capabilities as an object of improving firm performance by creating market orientation. Furthermore, this research empirically introduced strategic specific competence (tacit knowledge and autonomy) into the model and tests their effect of market orientation and firm performance. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Helm R.; Krinner S.; Schmalfuß M.	Conceptualization and Integration of Marketing Intelligence: The Case of an Industrial Manufacturer	2014	Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing	Purpose: The primary goal of this article was to conceptualize a systematic marketing intelligence process for industrial manufacturers because, up until now, such concepts have only been focused on consumer goods settings. Hence, this article investigates how marketing intelligence activities are developed and managed effectively in industrial markets.; Methodology/approach: The authors conducted a case study of Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen, a German based manufacturer of regulation technology for power transformers.; Findings: We found that a systematic marketing intelligence process should be based on the resource- and market-based view of strategy as well as on the market orientation construct. When implementing marketing intelligence, the integration of the sales force within the whole process is the crucial lever for an industrial company. The formalization of the process is necessary to ensure its continuity and acceptance; however, the varying intensity allows the necessary flexibility of the process.; Research implications: The constraints of the decisive process steps of marketing intelligence have to be further enhanced for industrial markets. It is important to find out how the integration of the sales force can best be designed to incorporate reward systems and motivation structures, and how to establish a corporate marketing-minded culture throughout the organization.; Practical implications: The important steps for a well implemented marketing intelligence process are a preparation phase, followed by the gathering, analysis, and dissemination of information. This article highlights the success factors for each process step. Above all, managerial and organizational commitment is necessary for the implementation of the whole process.; Originality/value/contribution: By focusing on the industrial manufacturing business, this study provides deep insights into a neglected area of research. Light needs to be shed on marketing intelligence in industrial markets, where the lack of traditional market research has to be compensated. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
Heinrichs J.H.; Lim J.-S.	Impact of marketing model application and competitive intelligence utilization on strategic response capability	2008	Journal of Strategic Marketing	Nimble competitors competing in a dynamic global marketspace increasingly characterize the business climate faced by many organizations. To provide the organization's marketing managers with the models and tools to mine information required to discover insights is becoming a major issue facing organizations. This study focused on investigating the potential combined impact of the marketing manager's marketing model application and competitive intelligence utilization on their strategic response capability. A two by three factorial design was utilized to test these combined effects. The MANOVA and ANOVA results show significant main and interaction effects of marketing model application and competitive intelligence utilization on the four identified factors of strategic response capability. These factors are labeled marketing strategy appraisal, insight generation, strategic response formulation, and pattern utilization. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.
Trim P.R.J.	The strategic corporate intelligence and transformational marketing model	2004	Marketing Intelligence & Planning	Reference to the strategic marketing and corporate intelligence interface is made explicit in this paper, and various contributions to the field of competitive intelligence are highlighted. A conceptual model, known as the strategic corporate intelligence and transformational marketing (SATELLITE) model is outlined, and can be used by corporate intelligence staff to provide better marketing intelligence. The SATELLITE model provides a framework within which strategic marketing staff and corporate intelligence staff can develop intelligence and security related strategies that can counter the moves of competitors and unwelcome protagonists. The model can also be used to identify areas of organizational weakness and can assist senior managers in identifying future areas of market opportunity. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited
Crosier K.; Pickton D.	Marketing intelligence and account planning: Insights from the experts	2003	Marketing Intelligence & Planning	Account planning as a discipline has been somewhat obscured from academic view. In practice, it has played a significant role in the development of the marketing communications (especially, advertising) industry although it has been adopted in varying forms and with differing emphases. It has been misunderstood by many. This paper offers a summary of the insights gained from the papers contained in this special issue of Marketing Intelligence & Planning; papers that represent many years of experience in the field; papers that are a mix of academic and practitioner perspectives. Collectively, they describe this faintly mysterious discipline more completely than any other published source of which we know. What is clear from the papers is the absence of any agreed succinct description or definition of what account planning should be in the current and anticipated future marketing communications environment. This paper attempts to remedy this situation by proposing a definition of account planning derived from this collective work which others may wish to accept, develop, repudiate or (best of all) debate. © 2003, MCB UP Limited
Pühringer S.; Taylor A.	A practitioner's report on blogs as a potential source of destination marketing intelligence	2008	Journal of Vacation Marketing	A primary role of Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) is to facilitate industry access to market intelligence and to ensure that operators understand their markets (both existing and emerging). Web logs, or blogs, are a relatively new form of market intelligence arising from peer to peer communication over the internet. The extent to which the content of blogs may augment DMO activities is unknown but is likely to depend on operator predisposition to e-strategies in general. This study reports on a survey of Kitzbühel Tourism operator's current online strategies andtheir level of awareness about blogs. The results show, while a core of businesses already monitor blogs in a strategic way, they may be struggling to meaningfully apply the fruits of these activities. A role for DMOs like Kitzbühel Tourism in moving operators forward in this area is identified. It is hoped that the practitioner's articulation of this role will provide other DMOs with ideas for the strategic use of what is currently a relatively untapped source of market information. © SAGE Publications Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore.
Tan Tsu Wee T.	The use of marketing research and intelligence in strategic planning: Key issues and future trends	2001	Marketing Intelligence & Planning	Many large companies in Asia are turning to market intelligence for input into their strategic management system and decision making. Conventional marketing research is increasingly viewed as being too narrowly focused on tactical and operational issues. It is characterized by an overriding concern with data rather than analysed information and the research is often conducted in response to an apparent market threat or opportunity rather than on an ongoing basis. This paper attempts to highlight the role of the Internet for market intelligence purposes. It proposes and demonstrates the marketing intelligence process, techniques and procedures, as illustrated by a case study on Creative Technology. Believes that the intelligent use of the Internet is strategically beneficial for both marketing research and intelligence. © 2001, MCB UP Limited
Walle A.H.	From marketing research to competitive intelligence: Useful generalization or loss of focus?	1999	Management Decision	The history of competitive intelligence (as an organizational function) and its evolution out of marketing research are discussed. Besides a straight historical overview, the transition from marketing research to competitive intelligence is analyzed in order to point to both the potential strengths and weaknesses of having intelligence form an independent “freestanding” discipline. While military analogies can be seductive, organizations should continue to embrace the marketing concept which centers on cooperation and service, not conflict. © 1999, MCB UP Limited
Novicevic M.M.; Harvey M.; Autry C.W.; Bond E.U., III	Dual-perspective SWOT: A synthesis of marketing intelligence and planning	2004	Marketing Intelligence & Planning	This paper proposes a cognitive approach of integrating marketing and intelligence views into a new “dual-perspective” SWOT framework. The new dimensions of SWOT are proposed to address the logical inconsistencies faced by marketing managers synthesizing SWOT components. By representing SWOT as the focus of practitioners’ cognition, researchers and consultants can capture the variability in managerial core logic employed to integrate a coherent strategic situation from a dual intelligence-and-planning perspective. Directions are outlined for this new avenue of marketing research. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Marketing in the Age of Intelligence: The Case for Control	1991	European Journal of Marketing	Revolutionising advances in computer and communication technologyhave pushed intelligence about the environment to the top of anorganisation′s resource priorities, and organisations into the“Age of Intelligence”. Marketing is increasingly defined anddriven by a managerial philosophy that explicitly acknowledges theintelligence dependence of the organisation in controlling relationshipswith key people who control critical demands and constraints in anenvironment of ceaseless change. The core concept of the emerging newmanagerial philosophy is the control concept. © 1991, MCB UP Limited.
Michaeli R.; Simon L.	An illustration of Bayes' theorem and its use as a decision-making aid for competitive intelligence and marketing analysts	2008	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose - This paper is intended to enable competitive intelligence practitioners using an important method for everyday work when confronted with conditional uncertainties: Bayes' theorem. It aims to show the mathematical concept of Bayes' theorem applies to competitive intelligence problems. Design/methodology/approach - The main approach is to illustrate the concepts by a near-real world example. The paper also provides background for further reading, especially for psychological problems connected with Bayes' theorem. Findings - The main finding is that conditional uncertainties represent a common problem in competitive intelligence. They should be computed explicitly rather than estimated intuitively. Otherwise, serious misinterpretations and complete project failures might follow. Research limitations/implications - In psychological literature it is a known fact that conditional uncertainties sometimes cannot be handled correctly. Conditional uncertainties seem to be handled well when they are about human properties. This should be verified or falsified in the competitive intelligence context. Practical implications - In general, the application of Bayes' theorem should be seen as one of the foundations of competitive intelligence education. Especially, when it is clear in which intelligence research situations conditional uncertainties can or cannot be handled intuitively, competitive intelligence education and practice should be adapted to these findings. Originality/value - CI practitioners can underestimate the value of Bayes' theorem in practice as they are often unaware of the (psychological) problems around handling conditional uncertainties intuitively. The article demonstrates how to take a computational approach to conditional uncertainties in CI projects. Thus, it can be used as part of appropriate CI training material. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Murray P.; Carter L.	Improving marketing intelligence through learning systems and knowledge communities in not-for-profit workplaces	2005	Journal of Workplace Learning	Purpose The purpose of the paper is to illustrate how marketing intelligence might be improved when an organisation's learning capacity is integrated and incorporated in well-defined organisational subsystems in a not-for-profit context. Design/methodology/approach First, given that market orientation is primarily concerned with gathering and desseminating marketing intelligence, the paper discusses the theoretical contributions from the learning literature related to interpreting the environment. Second, while many good ideas exist in not-for-profit firms, ideas are seldom linked to competencies that must be tracked and developed in the workplace. A more systematic view towards competency creation will increase the unique skills of not-for-profits and most likely improve their performance. Third, communities of practice are introduced as a way for not-for-profit firms to maximise dramatically the complex relationships that exist between various stakeholders and possible institutional investors. A number of propositions are offered that support the need for communities of practice. Findings In relation to P1 and P2, the workplace of a not-for-profit firm needs to be transformed. Establishing a culture of learning is the first step in making this transformation. Improving and advancing a firm's individual and organisational competencies (P3) suggests that individual and team training – depending on the type of not-for-profit activities – is needed. In relation to P4, the authors suggest that a firm's market orientation will be significantly improved by incorporating learning systems that resemble communities of practice. Research limitations/implications The propositions for this paper now need to be developed into a number of research questions. This paper has not provided an empirical validation and is limited by the prepositions related to the model. Subsequent testing of the model will greatly enhance its generalised findings. Practical implications Actual work practices in not-for-profit firms will be substantially improved, if not radically transformed, through a learning organisation culture. Originality/value This paper is highly valuable with very little research completed to date on this topic. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Tsu Wee Tan T.; Ahmed Z.U.	Managing market intelligence: An Asian marketing research perspective	1999	Marketing Intelligence & Planning	In recent years, world growth has slowed and markets have matured or become more protective. It appears that the only way for many companies to grow is at the expense of their competitors. Many large companies in Asia are turning to market intelligence for input into their strategic management system and decision making. The marketing intelligence cycle typically consists of directing, collecting, compiling, cataloguing, analysing and communicating data. The processing stage of intelligence gathering is the critical stage where the raw material is recorded and analyzed. In this article we use the SWOT framework for the analysis of a manufacturing industry – the lawn mower. This case illustrates how market intelligence could be used as an important and effective instrument for management planning, implementation and control. © 1999, MCB UP Limited
Trim P.R.J.; Lee Y.-I.	A strategic marketing intelligence and multi-organisational resilience framework	2008	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose - The paper seeks to explain how competitive intelligence officers can participate more fully in strategy formulation and implementation, and how they can contribute to the strategic intelligence process. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper presents a review of the literature and the development of a strategic marketing intelligence and multi-organisational resilience framework. Findings - Competitive intelligence officers can contribute more fully to the strategic intelligence process and help establish an intelligence culture that incorporates counter-intelligence. By adopting a broader understanding of what strategic marketing represents, marketing managers can devise new approaches to managing customer relationships and can develop international/global brand positioning strategies that when implemented counter the actions of legitimate competitors and new entrants, and disrupt the actions of counterfeiters and fraudsters. Research limitations/implications - A study can be undertaken to establish how a multi-organisational resilience value system evolves within an organisation, and how trust and credibility among competitive intelligence professionals can be developed. Practical implications - Academics and practitioners can collaborate in order to establish how an intelligence culture can be created within an organisation. Furthermore, they can also collaborate in establishing how a proactive approach to risk assessment can underpin scenario analysis and planning and aid the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value - A number of insights are provided into how competitive intelligence officers contribute to the development of a multi-organisational resilience value system that is underpinned by an intelligence culture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Fleisher C.S.	Using open source data in developing competitive and marketing intelligence	2008	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose - The paper seeks to show how the increasingly popular use of data and information acquired from open sources (OS) impacts competitive and marketing intelligence (C/MI). It describes the current state of the art in analysis efforts of open source intelligence (OSINT) in business/commercial enterprises, examines the planning and execution challenges organizations are experiencing associated with effectively using and fusing OSINT in C/MI decision-making processes, and provides guidelines associated with the successful use of OSINT. Design/methodology/approach - This is a descriptive, conceptual paper that utilizes and develops arguments based on the search of three unclassified bodies of literature in competitive and marketing intelligence, intelligence processing and marketing analysis. Findings - Open sources are useful in marketing analyses because they can be easily accessible, inexpensive, quickly accessed and voluminous in availability. There are several conceptual and practical challenges the analyst faces in employing them. These can be addressed through awareness of these issues as well as a willingness to invest resources into studying how to improve the data gathering/analysis interface. Practical implications - Marketing analysts increasingly rely on open sources of data in developing plans, strategy and tactics. This article provides a description of the challenges they face in utilizing this data, as well as provides a discussion of the effective practices that some organizations have demonstrated in applying and fusing open sources in their C/MI analysis process. Originality/value - There are very few papers published focusing on applying OSINT in enterprises for competitive and marketing intelligence purposes. More uniquely, this paper is written from the perspective of the marketing analyst and how they use open source data in the competitive and marketing sense-making process and not the perspective of individuals specialized in gathering these data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Büchner A.G.; Mulvenna M.D.	Discovering Internet Marketing Intelligence through Online Analytical Web Usage Mining	1998	SIGMOD Record (ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data)	This article describes a novel way of combining data mining techniques on Internet data in order to discover actionable marketing intelligence in electronic commerce scenarios. The data that is considered not only covers various types of server and web meta information, but also marketing data and knowledge. Furthermore, heterogeneity resolution thereof and Internet- and electronic commerce-specific preprocessing activities are embedded. A generic web log data hypercube is formally defined and schematic designs for analytical and predictive activities are given. From these materialised views, various online analytical web usage data mining techniques are shown, which include marketing expertise as domain knowledge and are specifically designed for electronic commerce purposes.
Mochtar K.; Arditi D.	Role of marketing intelligence in making pricing policy in construction	2001	Journal of Management in Engineering	The pricing strategy predominantly used in construction is cost based. But this pricing logic may lead to the underpricing or overpricing of a bid offer. In response to this problem, alternate pricing strategies are proposed in this paper that make use of market-based approaches. These models are centered on marketing intelligence functions. In this paper, marketing intelligence systems developed and used in manufacturing industries are explored, including marketing research, marketing information systems, and decision support systems. The current developments and practices of marketing intelligence in construction are reviewed. The findings of a survey that investigates the marketing intelligence and pricing strategy practices of the largest 400 U.S. contractors are presented. In conclusion, it is discovered that contractors use mostly traditional marketing intelligence strategies. It is recommended that contractors develop computerized intelligence activities such as using resources on the Internet and developing management information systems and decision support systems. As expected, it is found that "marketing intelligence capabilities" is a significant variable associated with pricing strategy.
Williams J.E.M.; Chaston I.	Links between the linguistic ability and international experience of export managers and their export marketing intelligence behaviour	2004	International Small Business Journal	This article presents the results of qualitative and quantitative investigations into the international background and language skills of export managers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and their export marketing intelligence behaviour. In doing so, it attempts to shed light on the relationship between these two sets of factors, both of which have been identified as affecting export performance. At the quantitative stage, non-parametric statistical analyses were used to identify profiles of export managers' information gathering, information use and decision-making activities, based on their linguistic ability, their experience of working or living overseas and their exporting experience. The research provides guidelines for SME employers who wish to match export managers' market intelligence styles with their firms' overseas market objectives. © 2004 SAGE Publications (London, Thousand Oaks and New Delhi).

Kursan I.; Mihić M.	Business intelligence: The role of the internet in marketing research and business decision-making; [Poslovna inteligencija: Uloga interneta u marketinškom istraživanju i poslovnom odlucivanju]	2010	Management	The purpose of this paper is to point out the determinants of the business intelligence discipline, as applied in marketing practice. The paper examines the role of the Internet in marketing research and its implications on the business decision-making processes. Although companies conduct a variety of research methods in an offline environment, the paper aims to stress the importance of Web opportunities in conducting the Web segmentation and collecting customer data. Due to the existence of different perceptions concerning the role of the Internet, this paper tries to emphasize its effort of an interactive channel that serves the function of not only an informational nature, but as a powerful research tool as well. Several data collection and analysis methods/techniques are discussed that would help companies to take advantage of a Web as a significant corporate resource.
Logman M.	Contextual intelligence and flexibility: Understanding today's marketing environment	2008	Marketing Intelligence and Planning	Purpose - Many planning approaches on strategic flexibility often focus on a product and/or market perspective. The purpose of this paper is to argue that today's changes demand a "contextual" marketing intelligence and planning approach. There may be a bigger difference between one person's actions in two different situations than between the actions of two people in the same situation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper's insights are based on a literature review and on insights from successful companies/brands (Google and Apple) dealing with today's changing business context. Findings - Strategic flexibility is decomposing a customer context and then making adjacency moves from some sub-contexts to a new broader context. It is about "zooming in" and "zooming out" to new directions. Practical implications - Recently, it is about the choice between operating in tailor made contexts (creating niches as a company) or operating in a more holistic context, in which new contextual moves are partly or fully determined by customers themselves. Originality/value - This paper gives another perspective on strategic flexibility.
Dishman P.L.; Calof J.L.	Competitive intelligence: A multiphasic precedent to marketing strategy	2008	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose - The paper seeks to explore competitive intelligence as a complex business construct and as a precedent for marketing strategy formulation. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,025 executives were surveyed about their companies' usage of competitive intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination as well as their perception concerning certain organizational characteristics. Findings - This research develops and tests intelligence as a precedent to marketing strategy formulation, revealing multiple phases and contributing aspects within the process. It also discovers that the practice of competitive intelligence, while strong in the area of information collection, is weak from a process and analytical perspective. Research limitations/ implications - While the sample was indeed a census of Canadian technology firms, care must be taken in generalizing the study beyond this industry, and certainly beyond the Canadian borders. Also, the questionnaire used only dichotomous variables (yes/no answers), which limited the testing that could be done. Practical implications - Using these results, competitive intelligence departments and professionals can improve efficacy within their approach and execution strategies. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is two-fold. It reveals many of the "state-of-the-art" levels of practice within current competitive intelligence efforts, and it proposes a model of the intelligence process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Lymperopoulos C.; Chaniotakis I.E.	Factors affecting acceptance of the internet as a marketing-intelligence tool among employees of Greek bank branches	2005	International Journal of Bank Marketing	Purpose - This paper aims to identify the importance that branch employees of Greek banks attach to the internet as a tool of marketing intelligence, and the factors that affect its acceptance as such a tool. Design/methodology/ approach - Using the technology-acceptance model (TAM) as a basis, a questionnaire is designed by the researchers, and completed by employees. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to analyse the data, and this confirms the relationships proposed by the TAM. Findings - The main findings of the study are that: branch employees of Greek banks feel that a marketing-intelligence system is a prerequisite for effectiveness in their work; although the internet is the fourth-most important source of market intelligence for branch employees of Greek banks, they require greater access to the internet to meet their market-intelligence needs; perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the internet directly affect bank employees' attitudes - which, in turn, affect the employees' intentions of using the internet as a marketing-intelligence tool; and education and working experience affect employees' attitudes indirectly (through perceived usefulness). Research limitations/implications - Main limitations of this study are related to the sampling method and the fact that the field research was conducted only in Athens, the capital of Greece. Originality/value - Finally, the paper suggests how banks could exploit the internet as a marketing intelligence tool for their branch employees and what actions should be planned in order to facilitate its adoption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Hill J.; Scott T.	A consideration of the roles of business intelligence and e-business in management and marketing decision making in knowledge-based and high-tech start-ups	2004	Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal	This paper considers the roles of business intelligence (BI) and e-business systems in enhancing the quality of decision making in knowledge-based and high-tech start-ups. A qualitative study, using in-depth discussions with 11 companies based in Northern Ireland, was conducted. The study examined the extent of BI usage and evaluated the extent of implementation of effective e-business systems in the sample companies. The study concludes that, whilst the sample firms recognized the value of both BI and e-business models, the modus operandi of the entrepreneurial high tech start-up is very much rooted in the traditional small firm paradigm of personal contact networking. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited
Le Bon J.; Merunka D.	The impact of individual and managerial factors on salespeople's contribution to marketing intelligence activities	2006	International Journal of Research in Marketing	Although salespersons represent a unique and important channel of information, few of them contribute efficiently to marketing intelligence. This research aims to understand how salespeople's motivation and effort to gather and transmit marketing intelligence to management may be influenced by individual (organizational commitment, desire for upward mobility) and managerial (control system, participation in decision making, feedback, recognition) factors. The test of the proposed model shows that desire for upward mobility is the only individual determinant of behavior. Other than participation in decision making, all the managerial factors play influential roles in structuring both motivation and behavioral effort toward marketing intelligence by salespeople. The authors also discuss the limits of the model, some managerial implications, and future research opportunities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Van Birgelen M.; de Ruyter K.; Wetzels M.	The Impact of Incomplete Information on the Use of Marketing Research Intelligence in International Service Settings: An Experimental Study	2000	Journal of Service Research	Unfamiliarity with foreign business environments and cultures will result in higher levels of uncertainty, especially for international service organizations. To effectively deal with international uncertainty, it seems crucial to have access to information that is as complete as possible. In practice, however, information is hardly ever complete. To date, little is known about the impact of incomplete information on the decision-making processes in international service firms. This article examines the effects of incomplete information on the evaluation and use of marketing research intelligence. The results of an experimental study suggest that decision makers in international service firms are unlikely to ignore missing information. Instead, they tend to adopt a strategy of inferential, assumption-based reasoning. Furthermore, the absence of information relevant to decision making in international services marketing has distinct evaluative consequences in terms of satisfaction, trust, and intention to use information. © 2000, Sage Publications.
